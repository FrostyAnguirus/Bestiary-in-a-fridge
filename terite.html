    <p>Terites are a race of ant and termite people. While in real life ant and
    termites are extreemly diferent, in whatever fantacy world you make they can
    be related. They are an inteligent race that make psudokingdoms in a variety
    of places.</p>
    <h3>Biology</h3>
    <p>Terites have many common traits between them. Their arms and legs are armored
    and have three didgets on each. they also have a much smaller set of arms above
    their waists, but these arent usefull and there isnt much controll over them.
    These much smaller arms are typicaly just held to the chest to prevent blows to
    the stomach. They have large heads, though the Termite's is usualy larger. Mandables
    are on either side of the mouth and antenae are above the eyes. Both are able to
    release a pharamone from their mouth that differ between colonies. Terites are
    exposed to their colonies pharamones at a young age. They learn how to release
    diferent pharamones and what they are asoceated with. These pharamones are almost
    undetectable and can only be detected by other Terites, weather or not they are
    in the colony. Humans and other races that have been rased by terites can detect
    the pharamones and know what they say, but this is usualy useless because they can't
    produce ther own to respond. Terites also have large abdomines to help them balance.
    If they lose their abdomin they are forced to walk on all fours untill they heal.
        Terites are split into two main groups; Ant and Termite. These groups have
        diferent adaptations that may occure in each.</p>
