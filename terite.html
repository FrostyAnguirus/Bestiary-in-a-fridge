            <p>Terites are a race of ant and termite people. While in real life ant and
                termites are extreemly diferent, in whatever fantacy world you make they can
                be related. They are an inteligent race that make psudokingdoms in a variety
                of places.</p>
            <h3 id="biology">Biology</h3>
            <p>Terites have many common traits between them. Their arms and legs are armored
                and have three didgets on each. they also have a much smaller set of arms above
                their waists, but these arent usefull and there isnt much controll over them.
                These much smaller arms are typicaly just held to the chest to prevent blows to
                the stomach. They have large heads, though the Termite's is usualy larger. Mandables
                are on either side of the mouth and antenae are above the eyes. Both are able to
                release a pharamone from their mouth that differ between colonies. Terites are
                exposed to their colonies pharamones at a young age. They learn how to release
                diferent pharamones and what they are asoceated with. These pharamones are almost
                undetectable and can only be detected by other Terites, weather or not they are
                in the colony. Humans and other races that have been rased by terites can detect
                the pharamones and know what they say, but this is usualy useless because they can't
                produce ther own to respond. Terites also have large abdomines to help them balance.
                If they lose their abdomin they are forced to walk on all fours untill they heal.
                Terites are split into two main groups; Ant and Termite. Both hatch from eggs the
                size of a boule of bread. These eggs are produced by their queen whos apearence
                differs between subspecies. The ant queens are simpily a larger version of the
                drones with the only major diference being that their second pair of arms are fully
                developed. Terite queens, on the other hand, are very diferent from their drone
                counterparts. Their arms are also fully developed, but their abdomin has soffened
                and swelled to the size of two horses standing in a row. Because of this they are
                very restricted in their movement as their legs can't touch the ground. Because of
                this, the queens tend to have their legs cut off to prevent pain from them jutting
                into their abdomine. These groups also have diferent adaptations that the drones may
                be born with or change to the list of adaptations differ for both varients.</p>
            <h4>Ants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stinger</li>
                <li>Shild Head</li>
                <li>Climing claws</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Termites</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Glue sprayer</li>
                <li>Masive jaws</li>
                <li>Crushing kick</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most terites can only have one of the adaptations at a time, but some can have two.
               They can change adaptations but it takes at least 8 hours of resting. During this
               proses they begin to shed their carapace and the old adaptation goes with it. The
               new adaptation then begins to grow from the terite untill it's fully developed. The
               shed carapace has the same effectiveness as when it was on the terite and they can
               be used as accesories. The stinger being a dagger and the shield head being a shield.
               These items only last for 24 hours before they go soft and unusable before becoming
               nothing more than compost. Terite saliva, if in a large enough quantity, can
               re-harden. This combined with the moldability of day old carapace is used to build
               structures for the Terite colony, but that will be covered later.

            <p>Terites are soceal in their own colonies. They do diferent jobs around the colony
               like working in the nursery, colecting food or feeding the queen. They rase livestock
               like any other kingdom. These livestock include typical things like cows aswell as more
               extravigant things like giant aphids. Some Terites go around the colony colecting shed
               skin and pasting it to weak sections of the walls. Once re-hardened, the shed carapace
               can be hard as stone while still being extreemly light and having the potential to be
               molded into diferent shapes. While this would be a great tool for stonework, the rock-like
               skin has to be smothered in a liquid the queen produces called royal paste once a month.
               Due to the dificulty for normal people to aquire this substince, this makes the terite
               carapace mostly useless in construction outside of the colony. Some colonies chose to
               stay on the move, while others chose to build their colonies out of giant leaves in the
               jungle. They have adapted to many enviornments </p>
                
                
            <p>Despite most Terites being biologicaly the same, they have a deep hatred for any other
               Terite that doesn't belong in their colony. They regularly send out scouting parties
               to see if any other Terites have invaded their teritory. If there are other Terite
               colonies the scouting parties send someone back to alert the colony. Solders rush to
               the front lines as the invaders attack. One of two things will happen. One, the
               attackers are held off and return to their colony for the inevitable counteratack.
               Two, the atackers break through and raid the colony. The defenders evacuate their
               queen and as many larvae as they can while the attackers do their best to capture
               as many workers of the opposite colony as they can. They take the prisoners and
               fallen wariors of both sides back to their colony. The workers are used as slave
               labor to expand the colony while the larvae are raised and brainwashed to become
               either slave workers or slave solders. If any of the prisoners are deemed to be not
               working hard enough they join the fallen solders as food reserves. While they are
               friendly to other races, their sheer brutality in combat makes the Terites dangerous
               and setelments have resorted to violence when dealing with Terites, which usualy goes
               porly. Reports of Terites keeping other races that atacked them as slaves isn't short,
               and children raised by Terites being used as wariors is extensive. This cycle of fear,
               violence and misinformation has dug the Terite's reputation into the dirt they came from.</p>
