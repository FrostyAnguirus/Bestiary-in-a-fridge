            <p>Myrmidon are a race of ant and termite people. They are an inteligent race that
                make psudokingdoms in a variety of places.</p>
            <h3 id="biology">Biology</h3>
            <p>Myrmidons have many common traits between them. Their arms and legs are armored
                and have three didgets on each. They also have a much smaller set of arms above
                their waists, but these arent usefull and there isnt much controll over them.
                These much smaller arms are typicaly just held to the chest to prevent blows to
                the stomach. They have large heads, though the Termite's is usualy larger. Mandables
                are on either side of the mouth and antenae are above the eyes. Both are able to
                release a pharamone from their mouth that differ between colonies. Myrmidons are
                exposed to their colonies pharamones at a young age. They learn how to release
                diferent pharamones and what they are asoceated with. These pharamones are almost
                undetectable and can only be detected by other Myrmidons, weather or not they are
                in the colony. Humans and other races that have been rased by Myrmidons can detect
                the pharamones and know what they say, but this is usualy useless because they can't
                produce ther own to respond. Myrmidons also have large abdomines to help them balance.
                If they lose their abdomin they are forced to walk on all fours untill they heal</p>

                <p>Myrmidons are split into two main groups; Ant and Termite. Both hatch from eggs the
                size of a boule of bread. The Myrmidons start as larvae when they hatch and slowly
                grow limbs. Their role in the colony is determined by what their fed in this stage.
                They will be workers if they feed on primarily plants and fungus and Woriors if
                primarily meat. if they are fed a substence called royal jelly which is produced by
                the queen, they will become one themselves. The queens are the only members of the
                colony who may produce eggs. Their apearence differs between subspecies. The ant
                queens are simpily a larger version of the drones with the only major diference being
                that their second pair of arms are fully developed. Myrmidon queens, on the other hand,
                are very diferent from their drone counterparts. Their arms are also fully developed,
                but their abdomin has soffened and swelled to the size of two horses standing in a row.
                Because of this they are very restricted in their movement as their legs can't touch
                the ground. Because of this, the queens tend to have their legs cut off to prevent
                pain from them jutting into their abdomine. These groups also have diferent adaptations
                that the drones may be born with or change to the list of adaptations differ for both
                varients.</p>
            <h4>Ants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stinger</li>
                <li>Shild Head</li>
                <li>Climing claws</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Termites</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Glue sprayer</li>
                <li>Masive jaws</li>
                <li>Crushing kick</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most Myrmidons can only have one of the adaptations at a time, but some are able to have two.
               They can change adaptations but it takes at least 8 hours of resting. During this
               proses they begin to shed their carapace and the old adaptation goes with it. The
               new adaptation then begins to grow from the Myrmidon untill it's fully developed. The
               shed carapace has the same effectiveness as when it was on the Myrmidon and they can
               be used as accesories. The stinger being a dagger and the shield head being a shield.
               These items only last for 24 hours before they go soft and unusable before becoming
               nothing more than compost. Myrmidon saliva, if in a large enough quantity, can
               re-harden. This combined with the moldability of day old carapace is used to build
               structures for the Myrmidon colony, but that will be covered later.
            </p>
            <h3 id="comunity">Comunity</h3>
            <p>Myrmidons are soceal in their own colonies. Similar to how most common races like
               humans elves and dwarves, Myrmidons have diferent titles based on their genders, Myrmidon
               for male and Myrmex for female. They do diferent jobs around the colony
               like working in the nursery, colecting food or feeding the queen. They rase livestock
               like any other kingdom. These livestock include typical things like cows aswell as more
               extravigant things like giant aphids. Some Myrmidons go around the colony colecting shed
               skin and pasting it to weak sections of the walls. Once re-hardened, the shed carapace
               can be hard as stone while still being extreemly light and having the potential to be
               molded into diferent shapes. While this would be a great tool for stonework, the rock-like
               skin has to be smothered innroyal jelly once a month to prevent them from becoming soft again.
               Due to the dificulty for normal people to aquire this substince, this makes the Myrmidon
               carapace mostly useless in construction outside of the colony. Some colonies chose to
               stay on the move, while others chose to build their colonies out of giant leaves in the
               jungle. They have adapted to many enviornments </p>
                
                
            <p>Despite most Myrmidons being biologicaly the same, they have a deep hatred for any other
               Terite that doesn't belong in their colony. They regularly send out scouting parties
               to see if any other Myrmidons have invaded their teritory. If there are other Myrmidon
               colonies the scouting parties send someone back to alert the colony. Solders rush to
               the front lines as the invaders attack. One of two things will happen. One, the
               attackers are held off and return to their colony for the inevitable counteratack.
               Two, the atackers break through and raid the colony. The defenders evacuate their
               queen and as many larvae as they can while the attackers do their best to capture
               as many workers of the opposite colony as they can. They take the prisoners and
               fallen wariors of both sides back to their colony. The workers are used as slave
               labor to expand the colony while the larvae are raised and brainwashed to become
               either slave workers or slave solders. If any of the prisoners are deemed to be not
               working hard enough they join the fallen solders as food reserves. While they are
               friendly to other races, their sheer brutality in combat makes the Myrmidons dangerous
               and setelments have resorted to violence when dealing with Myrmidons, which usualy goes
               porly. Reports of Myrmidons keeping other races that atacked them as slaves isn't short,
               and children raised by Myrmidons being used as wariors is extensive. This cycle of fear,
               violence and misinformation has dug the Myrmidon's reputation into the dirt they came from.</p>
            <h3 id="insperation">Insperation</h3>
               <p>The Myrmidon's are based off the xenomorphs from the alien franchise and the fictional
               mythic woriors of the same name. The story of the Myrmidons originate with Zeus having an
               affair with a woman named Eurymedousa. After the child was born, Hera found out and decided to curse Aegina, an island were
               they were on with a deadly plague. Zeuse's son, Aeacus, begged him to repopulate the island after the plague
               disapeared and Zeuse decided to turn a colony of ants into the wariors who became the Myrmidons.
               The reason why Zeus chose ants is because of a girl named Myrmex. She was loved by Athena and
               helped her create the plough. However, Myrmex stole the plough, gave it to the farmers and
               claimed it was her invention. Athena, rightfully iritated, decided to turn Myrmix int an ant.
               Zeus felt pity for Myrmix and repopulated Aegina by turning ants int the Myrmidons.</p>
