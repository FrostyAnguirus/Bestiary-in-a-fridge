            <p>Terites are a race of ant and termite people. While in real life ant and
                termites are extreemly diferent, in whatever fantacy world you make they can
                be related. They are an inteligent race that make psudokingdoms in a variety
                of places.</p>
            <h3 id="biology">Biology</h3>
            <p>Terites have many common traits between them. Their arms and legs are armored
                and have three didgets on each. they also have a much smaller set of arms above
                their waists, but these arent usefull and there isnt much controll over them.
                These much smaller arms are typicaly just held to the chest to prevent blows to
                the stomach. They have large heads, though the Termite's is usualy larger. Mandables
                are on either side of the mouth and antenae are above the eyes. Both are able to
                release a pharamone from their mouth that differ between colonies. Terites are
                exposed to their colonies pharamones at a young age. They learn how to release
                diferent pharamones and what they are asoceated with. These pharamones are almost
                undetectable and can only be detected by other Terites, weather or not they are
                in the colony. Humans and other races that have been rased by terites can detect
                the pharamones and know what they say, but this is usualy useless because they can't
                produce ther own to respond. Terites also have large abdomines to help them balance.
                If they lose their abdomin they are forced to walk on all fours untill they heal.
                Terites are split into two main groups; Ant and Termite. Both hatch from eggs the
                size of a boule of bread. These eggs are produced by their queen whos apearence
                differs between subspecies. The ant queens are simpily a larger version of the
                drones with the only major diference being that their second pair of arms are fully
                developed. Terite queens, on the other hand, are very diferent from their drone
                counterparts. Their arms are also fully developed, but their abdomin has soffened
                and swelled to the size of two horses standing in a row. Because of this they are
                very restricted in their movement as their legs can't touch the ground. Because of
                this, the queens tend to have their legs cut off to prevent pain from them jutting
                into their abdomine. These groups also have diferent adaptations that the drones may
                be born with or change to the list of adaptations differ for both varients.</p>
            <h4>Ants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stinger</li>
                <li>Shild Head</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Termites</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Glue sprayer</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most terites can only have one of the adaptations at a time, but some can have two.
               They can change adaptations but it takes at least 8 hours of resting. During this
               proses they begin to shed their carapace and the old adaptation goes with it. The
               new adaptation then begins to grow from the terite untill it's fully developed. The
               shed carapace has the same effectiveness as when it was on the terite and they can
               be used as accesories. The stinger being a dagger and the shield head being a shield.
               These items only last for 24 hours before they go soft and unusable before becoming
               nothing more than compost. Terite saliva, if in a large enough quantity, can
               re-harden. This combined with the moldability of day old carapace is used to build
               structures for the Terite colony, but that will be covered later.
