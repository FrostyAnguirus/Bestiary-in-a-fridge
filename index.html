        <div class="main"><P>Welcome to bestiary in a fridge, a personal world building project
            where I create and describe monsters and races. I plan to add traditional
            fantastic creaturs aswell as making my own for you to use. There are no game
            statistics tied to them so this is ment to help world builders and dungeon
            masters alike flesh out their worlds with uneque beasties. Below are a random
            assortment of races and monsters for you to see, but you can check the races
            and species tabs aswell as the search bar to look up specific ones you are
            interested in or wish to return to.</P></div>
