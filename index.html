    <P>Welcome to beastiary in a fridge, a personal world building project
    where I create and describe monsters and races. I plan to add traditional
    fantastic creaturs aswell as making my own for you to use. There are no game
    statistics tied to them so this is ment to help world builders and dungeon 
    masters alike flesh out their worlds with uneque beasties. Below are a random
    assortment of races and monsters for you to see, but you can check the races
    and species tabs aswell as the search bar to look up specific ones you are
    interested in or wish to return to.</P>
